how to check there is a swipe? 
- use api to get swipe gesture, and distinguish left or right horizontal swipe based on direction.x < or > 0
- issues: 
	+ not sure how far the hand needs to be distanced from camera (needs experiments)
	+ might detect multiple swipes in one swipe (needs to define a time interval for next swipe to be considered as a swipe)
	+ not sure how fast the hands need to swipe to be detected (needs experiment and maybe modify detect speed as well)

- what direction? / what does direction data mean?
